<h2>What is difficulty?</h2>
<p style="color: #DDD; text-align: justify;">
	The difficulty option determines what size the map should be, based on the number of players in the game. On easy, the size is at its maximum, on medium, the size is slightly smaller, and on hard, the size is much smaller, making it much more difficult when you're playing with more than two players.
